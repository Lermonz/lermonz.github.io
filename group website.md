#### we're my chemical romance apparently

importing the css file took us a while but was very easy, we wanted to make the background an image but was told it was too complicated
we wanted to make a custom font too but that was too hard.

i did a lot of testing on my own website to see how things worked before pitching them to the main website

overall the actual requirements for the website were easy:
import css file: easy
    change color of bg: easy (only after importing the css file, we tried doing it before and it was not possible lol)
import images: easy
import audio file: easy
also the link to another website we replaced so early i forgot we did it lol

but everything we tried to do additionally was hard and didn't work out (image/gif background, changing fonts, playing music in the background of the website)

nevEREMIND THE OFJNT CHANGING WORKED yay (not in the website linked earlier, in my own personal one hehe)

we each wrote a paragraph bio for the "band members"
mine was: "Yo what's cracka-lackin I'm Jichael, the best band member due to my epic and swagtastic skill on the sticks baby! Woo! Gimme some of that vampire money! Come on!"
